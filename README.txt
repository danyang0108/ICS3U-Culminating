For my ICS3U culminating, I have decided to create a tower defense game using javafx. 

This is the content inside the following files:

Resouces Folder - contains all the images used in the project

importantLocation - contains the coordinates of the spawn point of the enemy,
the coordinates of the house location, and other turning points 

Tiles - contains the state of every tile (1 represent occupied, 0 represent not occupied)

Winners - records the username of the player if that player wins

UserManual - includes the instruction and how the game works
